# Convert your daily rates

This app is useful to convert your rates and durations when needed.

For instance, you told your client your daily rate is 500 euros per day, but you think you're worth double, because you now work twice as fast as when you were worth 500 euros per day.

So you worth 1000 â‚¬ per day, but you don't want to change your rate with your client because he could not agree with you.

If you are sure about your value, there is no harm to invoice what you're worth.

That's what this tool is about, in French for now - I'll put it also English after 5 stars, or a PR is welcomed.

So : you type in the mission name, the duration you spent, the official daily rate, your prefered daily rate, and you let the IA work.

Now you click on "Capture", and the table is showing what your client needs to see.
